About
CLICKSTER is a fun memory game created with react.js.

The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

When the X is clicked it will DELETE the image until none are left.

     --Version 2 will be more interactive--

The application keeps track of the user's score and the user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time.

The user's score resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page is shuffled in a random order.

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.

         ENJOY AND HAVE A GREAT DAY!!!
